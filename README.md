## What is a Crypter?
A crypter is an application that is used to encrypt and obfuscate malware, making it nearly undetectable to antivirus and security programs.

## What is this?
A crypter written in python for malware written in python which utilizes AES.

This crypter utilizes the AES-GCM (Galois Counter Mode) since the GCM takes any amount of data as input and is also fast during decryption. Since a crypter usually encrypts the code once and it may expect multiple decryption processes for the encrypted code, a shorter decryption time is preferred over a longer one.
